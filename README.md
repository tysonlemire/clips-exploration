# Exploration of CLIPS

[CLIPS](https://www.clipsrules.net/) is a rule‑based programming language useful for creating expert systems and other programs where a heuristic solution is easier to implement and maintain than an algorithmic solution.

This is a personal repository for Tyson Lemire to learn more about CLIPS and explore its application in various environments.
